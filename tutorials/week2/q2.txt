What is the difference between each kind of iterator?

    Input iterator
    Output iterator
    Forward iterator
    Bidirectional iterator
    Random-access iterator


for input iterator, you only are receiving that means you can read access and compare them. not write
for output itreator, you can only read to and cant read, access

both of these iterator can be iterated forward, but we cant go back and save  the previous result somewhere i guess

forward means you can only move forward



input cannot make multiple passes w
